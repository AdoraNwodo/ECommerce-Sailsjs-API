# @sailshq/connect-redis

A fork of connect-redis with ongoing maintenance from the [Sails core team](http://sailsjs.com/about), designed to make it easier to know what version to install in your Sails app.

This package will only be published when there are immediate, material issues affecting expected usage, annoying NPM deprecation warnings, or when a major version bump is necessary.  Our goal is to diverge as little as possible.
